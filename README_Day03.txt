## NumPy Practice and Neural Network

This file includes practice exercises using NumPy.

### Part 1 – NumPy Fundamentals

The following basic concepts were reviewed and implemented:

* Creating arrays
* Array indexing and slicing
* Mathematical operations
* Matrix operations
* Shape and dimension handling

### Part 2 – Neural Network with NumPy

After reviewing the fundamentals, a simple two-layer neural network was implemented from scratch using NumPy, including:

* Forward propagation
* Backpropagation
* Binary cross-entropy loss
* Model training and evaluation

This work is part of my learning process in Python, machine learning, and neural networks.
